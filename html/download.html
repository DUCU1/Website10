            <article class="platformRequirements">
                <h2>Platform requirements</h2>
                <p>To run Java programs, you need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
                    The JDK is available for download from the Oracle website, and you should choose the appropriate version for your operating system.
                    Additionally, your system should meet the minimum hardware and software requirements for the JDK version you're using.
                    This information is typically available on the Oracle website or in the JDK documentation.
                    By ensuring that your system meets the platform requirements,
                    you can ensure that your Java project runs smoothly and without any issues.</p>
